Our workflow generates and exports satellite imagery data from Google Earth Engine for analysis in Tensorflow.  This analysis predicts the probability of the presence of a solar array as a function of the visible, infrared, and near infrared bands in Sentinel-2 imagery.  The model is a [fully convolutional neural network (FCNN)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), specifically [U-net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).  This relatively simple model is a mostly unmodified version of [this example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/outreach/blogs/segmentation_blogpost/image_segmentation.ipynb) from the TensorFlow docs.

The key step is sampling the array image at points, to get all the pixels in a 256x256 neighborhood at each point.  It's worth noting that to build the training and testing data for the FCNN, you export a single TFRecord file that contains patches of pixel values in each record.  You do NOT need to export each training/testing patch to a different image.  Since each record potentially contains a lot of data (especially with big patches or many input bands), some manual sharding of the computation is necessary to avoid the `computed value too large` error.

In terms of the shape, the model is trained on 256x256 patches, but can work (in theory) on any patch that's big enough with even dimensions ([reference](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)).  Because of tile boundary artifacts, give the model slightly larger patches for prediction, then clip out the middle 256x256 patch.  This is controlled with a kernel buffer, half the size of which will extend beyond the kernel buffer.  For example, specifying a 128x128 kernel will append 64 pixels on each side of the patch, to ensure that the pixels in the output are taken from inputs completely covered by the kernel.
